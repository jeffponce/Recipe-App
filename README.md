# Recipe Application

This would be my second JavaScript project which is part of a Training Course I am currently taking. This app we have a simple budget tracker with the ability to calculate the percentages of your expenses versus your total budget, or income. Key concepts learned were project planning and architecture. Using a UI Controller, App Controller, and Global Controller to structure your functions and methods to keep your code private. DOM manipulation, object prototypes, CSS styling, HTML, and event delegation.
