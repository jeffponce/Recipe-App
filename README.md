# Recipe Application

Capstone JavaScript project which is part of a Training Course I am currently taking. This application is a recipe website that allows you to search recipes from the database, returning cooking time, serving size, and the ingredients. We also have the ability to create a shopping list with the recipe's ingredients. 

We used modern Javascript and with webpack to develop and bundle our code. On this project we used the MVC, or Model-View-Controller, software design method to divide the processes of the app for better development. DOM manipulation, object prototypes, CSS styling, HTML, and event delegation were also used.
